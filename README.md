# Hotel App
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Below you will find some information on how to perform common tasks.<br>
You can find the most recent version of this guide [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

## Prerequisites
You need to have nodejs installed on your machine. If you donâ€™t, please go to [here](https://nodejs.org) and download the latest version. We need this because we use npm (node package manager) to manage all the dependencies and packages we use in our project.
